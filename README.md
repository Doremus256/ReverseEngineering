Motivation:
<br>
<br>
The application I was tasked with reverse engineering is a simple user authntication app that uses sequelize to create and manipulate tables within our database, and passport to facilitate local logins using emails and passwords. In order to fully understand this application I had to record and re-record myself a dozen times, and by doing so I was able to catch things I missed like how the app can take hashed password characters and compare them to records in our User table of authenticated users. 
<br>
<br>
I look forward to taking on this task of reverse engineering more and more complex applications as I found it to be a valuable learning tool.

Thank You
